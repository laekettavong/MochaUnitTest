# MochaUnitTest
Like [SimpleTestRunner](https://github.com/laekettavong/SimpleTestRunner), this is a simple demonstration on how to create/run unit test suite against a few arbitrary string, number, and date functions. Unlike SimpleTestRunner, this uses `mocha`, `chai` assertion/expect, and `eslint`. To that end, corresponding utility classes were created and tested against for behavior predictability when they are invoked with expected and unexpected arguments.
